Exchange Server Health Check Report
-------------------------------------

1. Exchange Services Status
# Check that all Exchange services are running and set to the correct startup type. 
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "*Exchange*" -and $_.DisplayName -notlike "*Hyper-V*" } | Format-Table DisplayName, Name, Status

2. Mailbox Database Status
#Verify that all mailbox databases are mounted and examine whitespace:
Get-MailboxDatabase -Status | ft Name,Mounted,DatabaseSize,AvailableNewMailboxSpace

3. DAG Replication Health (if applicable)
# Check database copy status and run replication health tests:
Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus *
Test-ReplicationHealth

4. Mail Flow Health
#Test internal mail flow:
Test-Mailflow -TargetEmailAddress <test@domain.com>

#Check mail queues:
Get-Queue

5. Exchange Service Health
#Verify that essential Exchange services are operational:
Test-ServiceHealth

6. Outlook and Web Services
